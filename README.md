# NMPC_Terminal_Region_in_Python

The nonlinear MPC scheme with guaranteed maximal terminal region based stability

The model is from Chen et. al AUTOMATICA 1998.

The code in this repo is inspired by [https://github.com/ZehuaJia/NMPC_Terminal_Region](https://github.com/ZehuaJia/NMPC_Terminal_Region)

The get_max_terminal.py adopts the algorithm from Chen, W. H., O'Reilly, J., & Ballance, D. J. (2003). On the terminal region of model predictive control for non‐linear systems with input/state constraints. International journal of adaptive control and signal processing, 17(3), 195-207.
